Ben is a versatile full-stack engineer who has journeyed across the technical landscapeâ€”from backend to frontend and even DevOps. Today, he juggles an Elixir LiveView application while crafting features in Node.js and React.

With a career built on adaptability, Ben approaches software development with a holistic perspective. He thrives on complex challenges and builds robust, maintainable solutions that stand the test of time.

When not immersed in code, Ben can be found exploring the outdoors with his loyal companion Rocky, or embracing the beautiful chaos of parenting his 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter. Their energy and curiosity constantly remind him why he loves building things that matter.
