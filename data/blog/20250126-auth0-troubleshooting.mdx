## Immediate Auth0 Logout on One Machine

When Auth0 logins immediately fail on just one machine (but work fine elsewhere), it often indicates **something local** on that specific system interfering with the Auth0 session flow. Typically, it's about **cookies, system clock issues, or local security/privacy settings** that invalidate the Auth0 session token right after it's issued.

Below are common causes and fixes:

---

### 1. System Clock / Time Mismatch

**Symptom:**
If your computer's clock is significantly off (even by a few minutes), Auth0's tokens can appear expired or not yet valid.

**Fix:**
- Ensure your system clock is correct and in sync. On macOS, enable "Set date and time automatically" in **System Settings → General → Date & Time**.
- If you're in a corporate environment, verify NTP is not blocked or failing.

### 2. Browser Cookie or Session Blocking

**Symptom:**
Auth0 relies on cookies to maintain session state. If your browser or an extension is blocking third-party cookies, local storage, or is set to "always private" mode, the token/cookie from Auth0 can't be stored—resulting in an immediate logout.

**Fix:**
1. **Check browser privacy settings:**
   - In Chrome:
     - Go to **Settings → Privacy and security → Cookies and other site data**
     - Ensure third-party cookies are **not** blocked, or whitelist your Auth0 domain.
   - In Safari:
     - Go to **Preferences → Privacy**
     - If "Prevent cross-site tracking" is enabled, it may block Auth0 cookies; consider turning it off or adding an exception.
2. **Disable or reconfigure any ad-blockers or tracking blockers** (e.g., uBlock, Ghostery, Brave shields, etc.) that might silently block Auth0 domains or cookies.
3. **Try a different browser** to see if the problem persists. If it works there, it's likely a browser privacy/cookie issue.

### 3. Firewall, Security Tools, or VPN/Proxy

**Symptom:**
Some tools (e.g., Little Snitch, Lulu, antivirus software, corporate VPN/proxy) can block or modify traffic to/from Auth0 domains—thus breaking the login handshake.

**Fix:**
- Temporarily **disable** or **reconfigure** these security tools to allow Auth0 traffic (usually `*.auth0.com`).
- If you are behind a corporate VPN/proxy, verify that Auth0 endpoints are **allowed** and that TLS/SSL inspection isn't rewriting certificates or injecting headers.

### 4. Corrupted Network or System Configuration

**Symptom:**
If there's a deeper network config problem on macOS (e.g., broken DNS or leftover network preference files), requests to Auth0 might fail or come from an unexpected domain/IP.

**Fix:**
- **Flush DNS**:
  ```bash
  sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

	•	Reset DHCP / network interface (if relevant):

# Replace "Wi-Fi" with the network service name from:
# networksetup -listallnetworkservices

sudo networksetup -setdhcp "Wi-Fi"


	•	Temporarily move/rename /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist and NetworkInterfaces.plist to reset all network prefs (then reboot). Only do this if you're comfortable losing saved network settings.

5. Hostname Resolution Errors (e.g., /etc/hosts)

Symptom:
If you've modified /etc/hosts or use custom DNS, requests for your-tenant.auth0.com could be incorrectly routed.

Fix:
	•	Check /etc/hosts for any unusual entries related to your Auth0 domain. Remove or comment them out if present.
	•	Verify your DNS server is set correctly and can resolve *.auth0.com.

How to Narrow Down the Cause
	1.	Try a Different Browser: If it works in Firefox but not Safari/Chrome (or vice versa), that points to a browser privacy/cookie setting.
	2.	Use a Different macOS User Account: Create a fresh local account. If Auth0 works there, it's likely user-level config (browser settings, firewall rules, etc.).
	3.	Disconnect from VPN / Security Tools: If turning them off fixes the issue, you've found your culprit.
	4.	Check the System Clock: Verify your date/time is accurate.

Key Takeaway

An immediate logout after a seemingly successful Auth0 login is almost always due to token validation failure—which, on a single affected machine, typically means time sync issues, cookie blocking, or local firewall/hosts manipulation. Adjust your environment—by changing browser privacy settings, syncing the system clock, or clearing out local misconfigurations—to resolve the issue.
