## Introduction

Blockchains are pretty interesting from a technical perspective, and while the production ones like Bitcoin are super complex, the core ideas are actually pretty simple. This is ExBlock - a basic blockchain I built in Elixir to understand how the fundamental pieces work. It's nothing fancy, just a clean implementation of the essential concepts in about 200 lines of code.

## What ExBlock Does

This is a simple blockchain that covers the basics:

- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA256 to validate blocks
- **Chain Integrity**: Blocks link to each other through hashes
- **Genesis Blocks**: The first block that starts the chain
- **Data Storage**: You can put arbitrary data in blocks
- **Validation**: Check if a blockchain is valid or corrupted
- **Functional Design**: Clean Elixir code that's easy to test

The project has four main modules:

- `Block` - Individual block structure and validation
- `Crypto` - Cryptographic hashing functions
- `Blockchain` - Chain operations and validation
- `ExBlock` - Main application module

## Technical Implementation

### Block Structure

Every blockchain needs blocks. Here's what our blocks look like:

```elixir
defmodule Block do
  defstruct [:data, :timestamp, :prev_hash, :hash]

  def new(data, prev_hash) do
    %Block{
      data: data,
      timestamp: NaiveDateTime.utc_now(),
      prev_hash: prev_hash,
      hash: nil
    }
  end

  def zero do
    %Block{
      data: "ZERO_DATA",
      timestamp: NaiveDateTime.utc_now(),
      prev_hash: "ZERO_HASH",
      hash: nil
    }
  end
end
```

Each block has:

- **Data**: Whatever you want to store
- **Timestamp**: When it was created
- **Previous Hash**: Links to the previous block
- **Hash**: The block's own cryptographic fingerprint

### Hashing

The `Crypto` module handles all the hashing with SHA256:

```elixir
defmodule Crypto do
  @hash_fields [:data, :timestamp, :prev_hash]

  def hash(%Block{} = block) do
    block
    |> Map.take(@hash_fields)
    |> Poison.encode!
    |> sha256
  end

  def put_hash(%{} = block) do
    %{block | hash: hash(block)}
  end

  defp sha256(binary) do
    :crypto.hash(:sha256, binary) |> Base.encode16
  end
end
```

Key points:

- Only data, timestamp, and prev_hash go into the hash calculation
- Uses standard SHA256 with uppercase hex output

### Blockchain Operations

The `Blockchain` module manages the actual chain:

```elixir
defmodule Blockchain do
  def new do
    genesis = Block.zero() |> Crypto.put_hash()
    [genesis]
  end

  def insert(blockchain, data) do
    prev_block = List.first(blockchain)

    new_block =
      Block.new(data, prev_block.hash)
      |> Crypto.put_hash()

    [new_block | blockchain]
  end

  def valid?(blockchain) do
    blockchain
    |> Enum.reverse()
    |> validate_chain()
  end
end
```

The blockchain is just a list with the newest block at the front - works well with Elixir's list structure.

## Why Elixir Works Well

A few things that made this easier in Elixir:

### Immutability

Since everything is immutable by default, blockchain operations naturally return new chains rather than modifying existing ones.

### Pattern Matching

The recursive validation logic is clean:

```elixir
defp validate_chain([]), do: false
defp validate_chain([genesis_block]), do: Block.valid?(genesis_block)
defp validate_chain([prev_block | [current_block | _] = rest]) do
  Block.valid?(prev_block) &&
  Block.valid?(current_block, prev_block) &&
  validate_chain(rest)
end
```

## What's Missing

This is obviously a toy implementation. Real blockchains need:

- Consensus mechanisms (Proof of Work, etc.)
- Network communication
- Persistent storage
- Transaction handling
- Digital signatures
- Performance optimizations

## Testing

The project has 43 tests covering the basics:

- Block creation and validation
- Hash consistency
- Chain operations
- Edge cases and corruption detection

Here's what it looks like running:

```
=== Simple Blockchain Test ===

1. Creating a new blockchain...
2. Inserting 'MESSAGE 1'...
3. Inserting 'MESSAGE 2' and 'MESSAGE 3'...
4. Validating the blockchain...
Blockchain is valid: true

5. Block details:
Block 0: ZERO_DATA (Hash: 9518E2175D869460...)
Block 1: MESSAGE 1 (Hash: 221FCFA6F4C72D12...)
Block 2: MESSAGE 2 (Hash: 48AAA0712AD7DD5A...)
Block 3: MESSAGE 3 (Hash: 7454D00D96F4FB1D...)
```

## What I Learned

### Keep It Simple

Starting with the basics and building up worked well. Each piece was easy to understand and test.

### Tests Help

The comprehensive test suite caught bugs immediately and showed exactly what the expected behavior should be.

### Debug Systematically

When everything broke, writing debug scripts to isolate issues was much faster than guessing.

### Functional Programming Fits

Elixir's approach of immutable data and pure functions feels natural for blockchain concepts.

## Try It Yourself

If you want to play around with it:

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/BenGlasser/exblock.git
cd exblock
mix deps.get
mix test
mix run test_blockchain.exs

# Interactive mode
iex -S mix
```

## Conclusion

ExBlock is a basic blockchain that demonstrates the core concepts in a clean way. It's about 200 lines of Elixir that cover:

- Cryptographic hashing
- Block linkage
- Chain validation
- Simple data storage

The functional programming approach worked well for this kind of system, and Elixir's pattern matching made the validation logic pretty readable.

It's definitely just an academic exercise, but it helped me understand how the fundamental pieces fit together. If you're curious about blockchain internals or want to see how functional programming applies to this kind of problem, the code is straightforward to follow.
