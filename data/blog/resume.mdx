## Professional Profile

My history illustrates a track record of successfully designing, building, and launching new software products. The achievements of which I am most proud have resulted in the creation of new verticals, the diversification of revenue streams, and had a direct impact on bottom lines.

Some notable tech I have worked with professionally includes Javascript, AngularJS, ReactJS, Python, Java, Elixir, Postgres, REST, GQL and SIP (RFC 3261) among others.

## Experience

### Fullcast | 2024 - Present

**Senior Software Engineer**

- Sole developer responsible for development of an acquired Elixir/Phoenix Liveview application
- Leveraged Terraform to migrate infrastructure from EC2 based service to serverless environment in AWS
- Feature development in core product using Node, React, and Typescript

### Divvy | 2018 - 2023

**Senior Software Engineer / Team Lead**

- Wrote an Elixir library to enable ACH parsing for ACH transfers both internally and externally.
- Built a receipt processing service in Elixir from the ground up which enabled customers to email receipts and have them automatically attached to the correct transaction. The project made heavy use of Elixir's GenServer and leveraged several AWS products including SES, SNS, and S3. Receipt matching was accomplished using a 3rd party OCR service to allow rapid deployment without having to invest the time to build an internal OCR service. A fairly trivial algorithm allowed us to achieve a 75% successful match rate on thousands of receipts per day.
- Did extensive backend feature work in elixir on our core platform, specifically pertaining to transaction ingestion.
- Extended and maintained our core GraphQL API using Absinthe, a GQL framework for Elixir.
- Serving as Dev Manager and Team Lead I spun up a team of 4 new engineers with a mandate to respond quickly to changing business needs by jumping on high-priority projects in order to accelerate development and get them over the finish line.
- Stepped in as Dev Manager and Team Lead for a team of 15 engineers using elixir as we developed the first product to expand the business's main offering with aspirations of adding a second stream of revenue.

### Oracle | 2017 - 2018

**Principal Software Development Engineer**

- Maintained services and systems for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure such as antivirus, dashboards, and AAA functions across several organizations.
- Used Chef to Automate Deployment of Services such as Grafana
- Used Python, Ruby and Chef to automate policies requiring users to keep home directories free of clutter and keep disk usage to a minimum
- Worked across several departments to publish documentation for new policies

### Jive Communications | 2013 - 2017

**Software Developer**

- As a backend java developer serving as both an individual contributor and team lead, I worked to build a complete replacement of our existing voicemail system, a core component of the platform.
- As a front-end developer, I made heavy contributions to Contact Center, the first new product ever launched outside the core platform, which added 10K MRR in the first month out of beta and enabled competition in a completely new vertical.
