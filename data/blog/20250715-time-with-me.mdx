**Find Free Time With Friends—Effortlessly**

## Description

This project is simple web app that looks at your Google Calendar and tells you exactly when you're available. You just pick a date range (like "next week" or "this month"), set your preferred hours (maybe 9 AM to 6 PM), and it scans all your calendar events to find the gaps where you're actually free.

Then you can copy-paste that list of free times and share it with whoever you're trying to meet up with.

One of the motivations for creating this was to explore serverless archetecture, specifically, realtime databases. I want to know how much I can getaway with when I don't have a server to depend one. Conversly, how much do I gain by not having to deal with servers.
